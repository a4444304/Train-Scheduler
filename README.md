## Description
The train schedule application incorporates Firebase, to host arrival and departure data for a train schedule. Firebase helped us access server side storage, which saves user information to a database that can be reused for multiple devices and sessions. The Moment.js library demonstrated date objects in JavaScript providing up-to-date information about trains and their arrival times.
